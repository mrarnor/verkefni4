<p>
(Introduction FMV. The camera pans slowly across a starfield for
several seconds before we see a beautiful young woman looking directly
at us. Green embers waft upwards around her face. The camera moves to show
that the embers are generated by a Mako furnace in a dark alley as the
woman stares into it. After a few moments, she turns and leaves the alley,
a basket of flowers on one arm, and stops to stand at a street corner.
Our view of her is momentarily obstructed by a massive train as it
speeds past through the town square. The camera swings outward through
the dark, dingy square, under a stone arch, and then begins to swing
upwards. The view moves higher and higher until the entire circular city
of Midgar comes into view. The Final Fantasy VII logo appears for a few
moments before the camera begins to swing back down, into a different part
of a city. A train is pulling into a station in another dark alley. Two
guards patrol the platform. Jessie flips spectacularly off the train. The
guards attack the intruder only to be knocked out by her skillful hands
and feet. Barret hops out of the train, turns, and motions for another
to follow.)
Barret
"C'mon newcomer. Follow me."
(He runs upstairs. Cloud flips out of the train and follows
him. Two guards come down the stairs down to the train
platform, blocking his path.)
(Battle sequence with two guards)
(After the battle, Cloud runs up the stairs and meets the
group - Jessie, Biggs, and Wedge, opening the main gate
to a Mako reactor.)
Biggs
"Wow! You used to be in SOLDIER all right! ...Not
everyday ya find one in a group like AVALANCHE."
Jessie
"SOLDIER? Aren't they the enemy?"
"What's he doing with us in AVALANCHE?"
Biggs
"Hold it, Jessie. He WAS in SOLDIER."
"He quit them and now is one of us."
"Didn't catch your name..."
(The PLAYER names Cloud)
Cloud
"...Cloud."
Biggs
"Cloud, eh? I'm..."
Cloud
"I don't care what your names are. Once this job's over... I'm
outta here."
(Barret comes running up from offscreen.)
Barret
"The hell you all doin'!? I thought I told you never to move in a
group!"
"Our target's the North Mako Reactor. We'll meet on the bridge
in front of it."
(The group heads through the gate. Barret stops and turns to face Cloud.)
"Ex-SOLDIER, huh? Don't trust ya!"
(The PLAYER names Barret)
Barret
"If you push the Directional button while pushing the [CANCEL]
button to run. (earlier marked X)"
(FMV sequence. The camera swings to show the Shinra headquarters towering
above as Cloud following Barret through the
gate. Cloud follows the others to the Reactor. Wedge stays on the bridge
in front of the reactor as the others head inside.)
Wedge
"I'll secure the escape passage. Concentrate on the
mission, Cloud."
"Geez, we're really gonna blow this huge furnace
up? This'll be somethin' to see!"
(Cloud follows the others into the Reactor.)
Barret
"Yo! This your first time in a reactor?"
Cloud
"No. After all, I did work for Shinra, y'know."
Barret
"The planet's full of Mako energy. People here use it
every day."
"It's the life blood of the planet. But Shinra keeps suckin' the
blood out with these machines."
Cloud
"I'm not here for a lecture. Let's just hurry."
Barret
"That's it! You're comin' with me from now on."
(Barret joins Cloud. The group works through the locked doors deeper
inside the reactor.)
Jessie
"Biggs and I got the code for this door."
Biggs
"Code deciphered"
(They go through the door.)
Biggs
"Think how many of our people risked their lives, just for this
code..." </p>
