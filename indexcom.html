The camera pans slowly across a starfield forseveral seconds before we see a beautiful young woman looking directlyat us. Green embers waft upwards around her face. The camera moves to showthat the embers are generated by a Mako furnace in a dark alley as thewoman stares into it. After a few moments, she turns and leaves the alley,a basket of flowers on one arm, and stops to stand at a street corner.Our view of her is momentarily obstructed by a massive train as itspeeds past through the town square. The camera swings outward throughthe dark, dingy square, under a stone arch, and then begins to swingupwards. The view moves higher and higher until the entire circular cityof Midgar comes into view. The Final Fantasy VII logo appears for a fewmoments before the camera begins to swing back down, into a different partof a city. A train is pulling into a station in another dark alley. Twoguards patrol the platform. Jessie flips spectacularly off the train. Theguards attack the intruder only to be knocked out by her skillful handsand feet. Barret hops out of the train, turns, and motions for anotherto follow.)Barret"C'mon newcomer. Follow me."(He runs upstairs. Cloud flips out of the train and followshim. Two guards come down the stairs down to the trainplatform, blocking his path.)(Battle sequence with two guards)(After the battle, Cloud runs up the stairs and meets thegroup - Jessie, Biggs, and Wedge, opening the main gateto a Mako reactor.)Biggs"Wow! You used to be in SOLDIER all right! ...Noteveryday ya find one in a group like AVALANCHE."Jessie"SOLDIER? Aren't they the enemy?""What's he doing with us in AVALANCHE?"Biggs"Hold it, Jessie.

Once this job's over... I'moutta here."(Barret comes running up from offscreen.)Barret"The hell you all doin'!? I thought I told you never to move in agroup!""Our target's the North Mako Reactor. We'll meet on the bridgein front of it."(The group heads through the gate. Barret stops and turns to face Cloud.)"Ex-SOLDIER, huh? Don't trust ya!"(The PLAYER names Barret)Barret"If you push the Directional button while pushing the [CANCEL]button to run. (earlier marked X)"(FMV sequence. The camera swings to show the Shinra headquarters toweringabove as Cloud following Barret through thegate. Cloud follows the others to the Reactor. Wedge stays on the bridgein front of the reactor as the others head inside.)Wedge"I'll secure the escape passage. Concentrate on themission, Cloud.""Geez, we're really gonna blow this huge furnaceup? This'll be somethin' to see!"(Cloud follows the others into the Reactor.)Barret"Yo! This your first time in a reactor?"Cloud"No. After all, I did work for Shinra, y'know."Barret"The planet's full of Mako energy. People here use itevery day.""It's the life blood of the planet.
